# ultra-ctrl-f

This project comes from the identified problem of finding content within webpages. It's extremely easy to find written content, but what if I want to find my own picture in a web photography album of an event, for example? Ususally, I'd have to scroll the whole page (maybe using some filters, like time and location) until I found the desired content. The goal os this project is creating a browser extension that can help the user seamlessly find similar faces within any webpage.
